Some factors may generate questions when the pregnant woman and medical team are considering the option of vaginal birth or caesarean section. 
How certain aspects may influence this decision?
Considering the age of the patient, how many times she has given birth, baby delivery time (premature, timely, latecomer), mother’s blood pressure (low, normal, high) and any associated heart problems. Let’s investigate some statistics:


Looking at the graphs, we can take some information: 
Age, blood pressure, heart problems and delivery time are factors being considered for the decision of whether to proceed with a caesarean section.  
•	Age – being older seems to be directly related to the likelihood of having a caesarean;  
•	Previous deliveries – does not seem to influence the occurrence of a caesarean;  
•	Baby delivery time – the likelihood of having a caesarean is greater when the delivery happens in a timely manner;  
•	Blood pressure – out of normal limits (low, high) seems to be directly related to the likelihood of having a caesarean;  
•	Heart Problems – having heart problems prior or during pregnancy seems to be directly related to the likelihood of having a caesarean.  

Some more statistic results tell us that out of these five factors; blood pressure and heart problems are the ones that are more likely associated with caesarean delivery.  



This data was taken from [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Caesarian Section Classification Dataset Data Set]( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Caesarian+Section+Classification+Dataset), cleaned, explored and graphed using Python 3.
