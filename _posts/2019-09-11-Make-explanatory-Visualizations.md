###Looking into this image: 
![plot from fivethirtyeight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/mehtahickey-inconvenient-0830-1.png)

###I created this:
![my plot](https://github.com/VeraMendes/VeraMendes.github.io/blob/master/img/plot%20recreation.png)

###Not too bad for my first plotting experience!I hope to able to do much better soon.
