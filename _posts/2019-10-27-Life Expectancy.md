Recently, I finished a project based on a dataset taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/augustus0498/life-expectancy-who" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>.  
In this project I analyzed Life Expectancy based on Past trends. I looked into immunization, mortality, economic, social and other health related factors as well.  

Refer to my <a href="https://medium.com/@veramendes10/life-expectancy-how-past-trends-influences-the-future-4e0dc2a3c4fd" target="_blank">Medium Blog Post</a> for more details and have a look on my <a href="https://life-expectancy-project.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Web Dash Plotly App</a> for a little demonstration and some more analysis.  

You can find my notebook on my <a href="https://github.com/VeraMendes/Life-expectancy-project" target="_blank">GitHub Repository</a>.
