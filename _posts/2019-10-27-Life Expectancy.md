Recently, I finished a project based on a dataset taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/augustus0498/life-expectancy-who).  
In this project I analyzed Life Expectancy based on Past trends. I looked into immunization, mortality, economic, social and other health related factors as well.

Refer to my [Medium Blog Post](https://medium.com/@veramendes10/life-expectancy-how-past-trends-influences-the-future-4e0dc2a3c4fd) for more details and have a look on my [Web Dash Plotly App](https://life-expectancy-project.herokuapp.com/) for a little demonstration and some more analysis.

You can find my notebook on my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/VeraMendes/Life-expectancy-project).
