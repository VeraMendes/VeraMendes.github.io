## my history...

**My name is Vera, I embarked in a new adventure into the Data Science World in 2019 and would like to share this experience with you.**

**At the moment, I’m a Data Scientist currently working at Pluralsight, an Education Tech company.**

**I'm an accomplished and results-driven Data Scientist with a proven track record of leveraging data- driven insights to drive business outcomes with 4+ years experience in Data Analytics & Data Science and 10 years experience in Healthcare, Medical Imaging. Demonstrated success in developing and implementing advanced analytics models, leading cross-sectional teams, and bridging the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
In Pluralsight I'm part of the Data Science Decision Support team helping driving business solutions using advanced analytics models, in ZoomInfo I was part of the Business Intelligence team supporting mostly the Customer Success, Finance and HR teams and in Bloomtech Institute, I supported the learning and professional growth of Lambda school students mentoring, resourcing and being a leader for a group of 6 Team Leads and around 50 students while still a student working in projects and deepening my knowledge in Data Science.**

**But let me tell you more about my life before Data Science. I was born in Portugal and since I was a child, was always fascinated about learning. Physics, statistics, informatics and biology were always on my top School subjects and going to School was a pleasure. When choosing my career, I ended up going to a Radiology degree, because I could help people but still be connected with technology. After finishing my studies as BSc in Radiology, I decided to enter a new adventure and moved to London, England, UK where I lived for a decade. I worked as MRI Radiographer and I pride myself in being a good professional, promoting continuous improvement in service delivery, quality and patient care. While I worked in Healthcare I’ve progressed from a Junior to a Senior post, and in one of my latest roles, I worked as Superintendent MRI Radiographer managing a department and a team of healthcare professionals.**
**Being happy helping people, something was missing, initially I thought maybe I needed to take on some new hobbies and it is when yoga and swimming entered my life, but then I realized that I was stuck in my career and really needed a change in my career, this is when I thought I could contribute to the World in a different way.**

**When I first heard about Data Science, my curiosity started, suddenly I thought I could finally deepen my knowledge in statistics and still contribute to a better World. Data Science felt like magic, as if I could gain superpowers. A year ago, I moved to San Francisco, California. Adapting was the word that ruled my life, and with adaptation comes change so I decided to pursue my interest in Data Science and start a new career. It was the best decision I took and I entered a new World of work.**

**I am a citizen of the World who loves travelling and exploring other cultures and their history.**
**In addition to my passion for Data Science, I have a diverse range of hobbies that bring balance to my life. These include cherishing moments with my baby boy, exploring new culinary delights in the kitchen, honing my yoga practice (I am a certified Yoga instructor), immersing myself in music, embarking on hikes to connect with nature, indulging in refreshing swims, and unwinding with captivating TV shows and movies.**
