### my history...

My name is Vera, I embarked in a new adventure into the Data Science World and would like to share this experience with you.


I’m now a Junior Data Scientist currently finishing up my studies and working at Lambda School.

I’m a very dedicated hard worker, organized, self-motivated, humble and a flexible professional.

At the moment, in Lambda School, I support the learning and professional growth of Lambda school students mentoring, resourcing and being a leader for a group of 6 Team Leads and around 50 students while still a student working in projects, endorsement and deepening my knowledge in Data Science.

Previously, I worked as an MRI Radiographer for the past decade in London, United Kingdom. I pride myself in being an excellent professional, promoting continuous improvement in service delivery, quality and patient care.

While I worked in the Healthcare I’ve progressed from a Junior to a Senior post, and in one of my latest roles, I worked as MRI Superintendent Radiographer managing a team of healthcare professionals.

From the best of my knowledge and based on my overall experience, I believe I have abilities to perform well in a new challenge and that is why I chose to embark in this new adventure.


I am a citizen of the world who loves travelling and exploring other cultures and their history.
I have many hobbies including cooking, practising yoga (recently I certified as Yoga instructor), listening to music, hiking, watching TV shows and movies.
